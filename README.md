# 🧩 Design Patterns Showcase 🚀

Welcome to the **design_patterns** repository! 🎨 This project is dedicated to implementing various design patterns in C# through small console applications. 
The primary goal is to apply and understand design patterns in practical scenarios, project ideas are generated with the help of ChatGPT but coded by me. 🤖💻

# 📚 What’s Inside?

In this repository, you’ll find:
Small console applications demonstrating different design patterns.

## 1) 📈🔔 Stock App Notifier
Implementing the **Strategy** and **Observer** patterns, this app keeps you updated on stock price changes with customizable investment strategies. 📉📈
